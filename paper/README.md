# Theoretical Foundation

## geometric safety Theory

The Tri-Guard safety framework is based on geometric safety theory,
which provides a geometric foundation for AI alignment.

### Key Results

1. **Honesty Guard** — From Chapter 9: Total non-negativity (TNN) of attribution matrices
   ensures faithful representation of model reasoning.

2. **Wall Stability Guard** — From Israel thin-wall junction conditions: capability energy
   is bounded by a domain wall with computable tension.

3. **Holonomy Guard** — From flat connections in fibre bundles: trivial holonomy around
   loops in update space rules out reward hacking.

### SPDP Framework

The Shifted Partial Derivative Polytope (SPDP) framework from Chapter 7 provides:
- Polynomial complexity bounds via ROABP width
- Admissible inference regions as convex polytopes
- Observer-dependent rank measures
